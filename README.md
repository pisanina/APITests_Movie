# APITests_Movie
API tests for movies from themoviedb.org 

The site web site https://www.themoviedb.org/ has an open API, you should use the API to test the
following scenarios.
 
In Game of Thrones Nell Tiger Free plays Myrcella Baratheon, write a test to verify the following;
  The actor is not in season 6 episode 1
  The actor is in  season  5 episode 1 as main cast member but not as a guest actor
  The actor is in  season  5 episode 2 as main cast member and as a guest actor
 
For Breaking Bad write a test to confirm the following episodes per season is correct
Season Episodes
5 16
4 13
3 13
2 13
1 8
 
I was suprised that some of the tests failed. However, I was following requirements ( I double checked them). 
Thus, I am suspecting that it could be intentionaly.

Please insert your API key into APIKey in Config.cs
